# Voronoi
Fortune's Algorithm Impementation in C#

Fortune's Algorithm is a sweepline algorithm for generating a voronoi diagram from a set of points on a 2D plane. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm)

TODO: 

-Output the diagram in a DCEL instead of what is currently just a list of edges with no information of any of the faces stored anywhere. 
-Implement Lloyd's algorthm to make (prettier?) diagrams. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm)
