# Voronoi
Fortune's Algorithm Impementation in C#

[Fortune's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune%27s_algorithm) is a sweepline algorithm for generating a voronoi diagram from a set of points on a 2D plane. 

### TODO: 
- [x] Output the diagram in a [DCEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_connected_edge_list) instead of what is currently just a list of edges with no information of any of the faces stored anywhere. 
- [x] Implement [Lloyd's algorthm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_algorithm) to make (prettier?) diagrams.
